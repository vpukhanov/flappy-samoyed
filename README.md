# Flappy Samoyed

A simple Flappy Bird-inspired game created just for the fun of it (and for trying out some canvas APIs). Inspired by the included [AI-generated song](res/audio.mp3), which was generated after I requested a smooth jazz piece about Flappy Bird.

This was created for entertainment purposes only. The code was hastily thrown together just to make it work, so please do not use it for any production-related tasks. You have been warned ðŸ‘¹

## Demo
